The pfsteps Package

SYNOPSIS

    This package provides three facilities for making it easier to write
    proofs in LaTeX:

      1) proof step counters and references, inspired by Rémy’s
         locallabel package, but with a different interface;

      2) a proof display environment pfsteps for printing line-by-line
         proofs with justifications; and

      3) the byCases environment for proofs by cases.

BUILDING

    To build the PDF documentation and style file, merely run

        % make

    If you don't have make, it's possible to do it manually.  To create
    the style file (pfsteps.sty) and the documentation (pfsteps.pdf),
    run the following sequence of commands:

        latex pfsteps.ins
        latex pfsteps.dtx
        makeindex -s gind.ist pfsteps.idx
        makeindex -s gglo.ist -o pfsteps.gls pfsteps.glo
        latex pfsteps.dtx
        pdflatex pfsteps.dtx

    If you only want to build the style file, and not the documentation,
    only the first command (latex pfsteps.ins) is necessary.

    The documentation is also available on the web at
